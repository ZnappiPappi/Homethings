Nausea a book about people having to confront the horrifying truth and reak out of their bad faith

What causes the Nausea?? {
  Since there is no god we are responsible for determining our own essence and existence and the existence and essence of everything else
  As he discovers this new view on life he becomes like a god and has to explore and be responsible for determining and figuring out his world around him hence his viws and nausea 
  Bad Faith - you can either dissacociate from your current identity or you can from your perceived identitiy, both leading to bad Faith while roquentin is studying rollerbon he forgets of his own idenity , facticity /  transcendence
  when his view on objects starts to change it comes so quickly since its been repressed for years its very viscious as it reveals its new true identity
}
Why is Roquentin critical of the Autodidact Humanitarian {
  The Autodidact only really sees the transcendence ( Bad faith ) in other people, roquntin gives an example of the face showing the facticity instead
  The Autodidact turns out to be a pedophile, to the autodidact it is a primal instinct, the autodidac is in bad faith, he only focuses on the transcendence of people to run away and hide from his true facticity that he is a pedophile
