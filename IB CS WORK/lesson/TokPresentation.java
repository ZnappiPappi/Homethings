     * > What is ("Artificial Consciousness")??;
     * There are many different definitions of Artificial Consciousness, it looks at
     * intelligence, awareness and emotional capacity.
     * 
     * Consciousness or being conscious can be considered as being aware of your own
     * existence in a larger plane of reality,
     * so for artificial consciousness to be achieved, the AI would have to be aware
     * of its own existence to be conscious.​
     * 
     * Consciousness can also be defined as being aware of one's own actions, being
     * able to make emotional judgements
     * judgements based on a situation.
     * This expression of emotion must come through the AI learning what an emotion,
     * such as "anger" is,
     * how to experience it, how others feel when they experience it and its
     * intricacies
     * So, on top of being aware, the AI would have to experience what we call
     * "emotion" in some form.
     * 
     * Most of us take emotions "for granted", we all know how we feel when we cry,
     * laugh or smile.
     * For an AI to register, interpret and act on these occurrences, would have to
     * prove it a level of consciousness​.
     * 
     * And lastly, the theory by Alan Turning, for an AI to be considered conscious,
     * it must be considered intelligent, not just
     * acting intelligently, but essentially having it's own 'mind'.

     * > If an [AI] were to go through the (7 stages of grief), is it considered
     * conscious??;
     * Most of us take emotions "for granted", we all know how we feel when we cry,
     * laugh or smile.
     * For an AI to register, interpret and act on these occurrences, would have to
     * prove it a level of consciousness​.

     * The Hard
     * Problem of Consciousness]:
     * 
     * Introduced by (David Chalmer), philospher; {
     * > It is to explain how and why some organisms have subjective experiences;
     * 
     * Why? Why do we feel pain when we touch a hot object, from the perspective of
     * self preservation,
     * when we come into contact with a hot object we immediately pull back to
     * prevent damaging our tissues and feeling pain.
     * But this can be seen as the process of:
     * if (object.equals["hot"]) {
     * pull away = true;
     * }
     * Which is exactly how a reflex works.
     * Following this logic,when an electric kettle detects boiling water, it
     * switches off and stops boiling.
     * This is the exact same process as earlier with an input of stimuli and an
     * output of an action.
     * if (water.equals["boiled"]) {
     * switch off = true;
     * }
     * The only difference between these two processes though is that we feel pain
     * when we touch the object, so why
     * add the extra sense of pain to our experience? Are our feelings and senses
     * what give us consciousness?
     * 
     * Chalmers wrote: ["It is widely agreed that experiences arise from physical
     * basis, but we have no good explanation as
     * why and how it so arises. Why should physical processing give rise to an
     * inner life? It seems unreasonable yet it does."] ;
     * 
     * 
     * > How? How can our human brain, ('something that defines all laws of physics
     * and chemistry'), create subjective experiences?
     * The brain is extremely complex, a collection of neurons and links, but it is
     * still a device in the way that it operates
     * on chemical signals and reactions, just like how a machine operates on
     * electrical signals and reactions.
     * 
     * How can this device 'give birth' to subjective experiences when we feel
     * emotions such as happiness, grief, love and anger?
